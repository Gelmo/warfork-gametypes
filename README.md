# Todo:

## Clanless Arena

## Hoonymode:
- Use RBDuel as base, but need to add spawn selection and tennis-style scoring

## Ftag:
- Push frozen players? - Not possible in 2.1, maybe when ascgame is merged. "Theyâ€™re non solid because people were teleporting into frozen ppl and getting stuck"
- Remove defrost hazard multiplier for arena? - Tested with FTAG_INVERSE_HAZARD_DEFROST_SCALE and FTAG_INVERSE_ATTACK_DEFROST_SCALE set to 1, but matches went on too long. Set back to 3
- Fix defrost status indicator
- Implement Awards
- Currently, when a player falls through a pit, they don't respawn until their team loses a point. In QL, falling in a pit/lava respawns you (discouraging you from hurting opponents near a pit). Or just make them respawn when either team wins a point?

Things that need to be tested more in Ftag Arena with many skilled players:
- Armor and Health pickups on map (currently disabled in Arena)
- Powerup pickups on map (currently disabled in Arena)
- Respawning everyone (including health/armor refresh) when a team earns a point, like in CA
- Last update added weap/ammo pickups, and weap/ammo drops on death, which resolved the low-ammo issue. If it ends up being better to respawn everyone each point, it may be suitable to revert this and remove weap/ammo pickups (but retain weap/ammo drops)
