# Todo:

## Clanless Arena

## Hoonymode:
- Use RBDuel as base, but need to add spawn selection and tennis-style scoring

## Ftag:
- Push frozen players? - Not possible in 2.1, maybe when ascgame is merged. "Theyâ€™re non solid because people were teleporting into frozen ppl and getting stuck"
- Remove defrost hazard multiplier for arena? - Disabled in 0.9.4.1 for arena, testing
- Respawn both teams each round for arena?
- Show frozen teammates through wall
- Fix defrost status indicator
- Implement Awards
