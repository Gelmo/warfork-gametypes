Hoonymode

1v1 game mode where a new round starts after each death. The first player to win 11 rounds wins the match.

All in-game behaviour (weapons, physics, items, etc) remains the same as standard DM: the change is in how the game progresses from one frag to the next. During warmup, two spawnpoints are chosen by the players. One will typically be a "stronger" spawn and the other "weaker". When the game begins, these are where the players will spawn, with the strong spawn considered the equivalent of having the "serve".

Each player death (regardless of source, i.e. a suicide is considered a kill for the opponent) is treated as a distinct point. After a point is scored, play does not continue as in DM: instead, the players and the arena are reset, and a new point is contested for. Players switch spawnpoints at this time, so the player who had the weak spawn for the previous point now has the strong one, effecting a change of serve. Players are given a few seconds between points to reconsider strategies etc.
